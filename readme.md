# rules_pydeps

An aspect to enforce correct dependencies for `py_*` targets.

This aspect inspects Python sources to discover imports, and then verifies that imports are either local to the target or come from a declared dependency.

## Usage

This aspect will run over any `py_binary`, `py_library` or `py_test` target.

Presently, only bzlmod setup is supported.

**Add rules_pydeps to your MODULE.bazel:**

```starlark
bazel_dep(name = "rules_pydeps", version = "0.0.0")
```

**Configure the external deps analyzer:**

```starlark
reqs = use_extension("@rules_pydeps//pydeps:reqs.bzl", "reqs")
reqs.requirements(
    requirements_in = "//:requirements.in",
    pip_requirements = "@pip//:requirements.bzl",
)
use_repo(reqs, "reqs")
```

**Configure deps_enforcer aspect:**

Define a new aspect in a `.bzl` file (such as `./tools/aspects.bzl`):

```starlark
load("@rules_pydeps//pydeps:pydeps.bzl", "deps_enforcer_aspect_factory")

deps_enforcer = deps_enforcer_aspect_factory(
    pip_deps_index = Label("@reqs//:pip_deps_index"),
)
```

Update your `.bazelrc` to include this new aspect:

```starlark
# register deps_enforcer aspect with Bazel
build --aspects //tools:aspects.bzl%deps_enforcer

# optionally, default enable enforcement
build --output_groups=+pydeps
```

## Skipping Targets

Label any target with the tag `no-deps-enforcer`, or customize suppression tags:

```starlark
deps_enforcer = deps_enforcer_aspect_factory(
    pip_deps_index = Label("@reqs//:pip_deps_index"),
    suppression_tags = ["no-lint"],
)
```

## Customizing OutputGroupInfo

To make it easier to manage your aspects, it's possible to set an additional OutputGroupInfo name:

```starlark
deps_enforcer = deps_enforcer_aspect_factory(
    pip_deps_index = Label("@reqs//:pip_deps_index"),
    output_groups = ["lint"],
)
```

This may assist in configuring aspects to run together in your .bazelrc.

## Non-imported/Runtime Dependencies

Some Python libraries dynamically load dependencies based on what's on PYTHONPATH (such as `pyxlsb` for `pandas`). It may be necessary to import these dependencies, but the deps enforcer will detect these as extra imports.

To overcome this, add a tag to your target of the form `'runtime:requirement("dep")'` or `runtime://my/internal:dep`.

As an example:

```starlark
py_library(
    name = "example",
    srcs = ["example.py"]
    deps = [
        requirement("pandas"),
        requirement("pyxlsb"),
    ],
    tags = [
        'runtime:requirement("pyxlsb")',
    ],
)
```

It may be simpler to define a macro to handle this for you.
